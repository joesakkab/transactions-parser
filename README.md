# TransactionParserJavaProject
 This project uses two classes:
 - CSVTransactionParser
 - XMLTransactionParser

This is done by implimenting the TransactionsParser interface.

These classes take csv and xml files as inputs that contain transaction information and inserts them into a list of transacitons.
